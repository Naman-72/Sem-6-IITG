## Target Code Generator for NanoC

To build the program, there is a Makefile which can be run by invoking `make`.

On running `make`, the executable `nanoC` is generated in the root directory.

The test inputs are given inside `./test-inputs`. On running `make test`, outputs are generated in `./test-outputs`. The outputs consist of the Three-Address-Code representation and the symbol tables.
