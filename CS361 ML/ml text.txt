GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL 
ANY IMAGE CATEGORY : 
FOREST : 0.42 BLUE DIMENSION
SUNSET : 0.3
CLOUD : 0.8

NOW JUMBLE 
AND MAKE HISTOGRAM 

NOW MODEL BASED APPROACH TO SEPERATE
NOW CHARACTER SPECIFIC CATEGORY 
AND AVG THEM TOGETHER

BUT SIMPLE AVG ASSUME EQUAL PROPORTION 
BUT WHAT IF WEIGHTED 
THAN 

WE 'D WANT A WEIGHTED AVG 

WE INTRODUCE CLUSTER RATE
WEIGHT ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CLUSTER 
AND SUM = 1

NOW FOR EACH CLUSTER 
WE HAVE CLUSTE SPECIFIC MEAN , VARIENCE 
NOW ASSUME MULTIDIMENSION 


MEAN VECTOR , COVARIENCE MATRIX 
HIGHER DIMENSION : 
WEIGHT DOESN'T CHANGE WITH DIMENSIONALLITY BUT NOW INSTEAD OF JUST MEAN AND VARIENCE 
WE HAVE
MEAN VEC
COVARIENCE MATRIX
SHAPE AND ORIENTATION


WITHOUT OBSERVING IMAGE WHAT'S PROB OF IT FROM CLUSTER K 
: WEIGHT OF K 

WHAT IF WE KNOW ITS A CLOUD IMAGE 
WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD OF RGB VECTOR ASSOCIATED WITH IMAGE
SO CAME FROM Kth cluster In this case what we do : 
we go to the dist of cloud images 
xi : look at intensity




GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL
LEN , WEIGHT

RED : TUNA
ORANGE : SALMON
ASSUMES ALL CLASSES ARE DISTRIBUTED  : gaussian distribution
HIGH DIMENSION : mu 
instead of sigma : covarience matrix
it tells shape of distribution 
goal : try to find out best mu and sigma


NORMAL DISTRIBUTION :
BELL CURVE : 
MEAN , VARIANCE  
(stastics)
mean , sigma : distribution : how spreadness 
low sigma : compact
high sigma : spread 


gaussian mixture model 
try to find 
High level of Gaussian distribution model
N(x| mu , Sigma )
once we figure out parameter 

how to pick best pi , mu , sigma
P(X| pi , mu , sigma )
we want to maximize 
X  : N x Del 
Del : vector : multidimension

HOW WE DO :
ALL DATA POINTS 
NOW 
PROB IF THAT POINT IN ALL CLASSES SUM UP
BAYES THEOREM
