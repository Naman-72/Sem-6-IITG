// Binary Search Tree
// code done 

// AVL Tree 
// same as binary tree but after insertion u will have to check balancefactor along traversal in each node 
// 

// How to make Data Structures (like linked list, trees) persistent?

//  seeen code

// Synchronization Problems using Semaphores and Threads

We recommend that you start by reviewing the basics of each of these topics. Once you have a good understanding of the fundamentals, you can move on to more advanced concepts.
Each student will be assigned any one of the above topics and questions related to the topic will be provided in the lab itself.
