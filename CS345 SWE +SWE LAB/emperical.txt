Our primary intention is to refer  to software systems rather than  
any hardware so when we are talking about  interactive systems or human computer interfaces  


> code testing bug free
> emperical evaluation : ensuring product is acceptable to end users 
ensure usability of the product 


USABILITY : explicit measure to judge our  design if we have taken care of the human factors  
it is meant to be used by lay persons  who are not technology experts  
they are not interested actually to learn  about the technology behind the working of  
The system what they are interested in is  basically to get their work done for example  

> END USER 
: BEHAVIOURAL DATA : CONTROL EXPT 
ENTIRE PROCESS IS CALLED :
EMPERICAL RESEARCH :  

>> NOT EASY 
END USR : MAY NOT RELIABLE 
MENTAL STATE ETC 

WE WANT RELIABLE DATA : 
STAGES :
4 

first stage is identification of research  questions :
ANSWER TO FEW QUE
WHAT KIND OF QUE SO FIND GOOD QUE
FRAME QUE : GOOD 

second stage is determinism variables  :
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY VARIABLES IN STUDY 


COME UP  WITH PROPER DESIGN 


third stage is design of experiment and 
the fourth  and final stage is analysis of empirical data
